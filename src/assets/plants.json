    "details": "Notocactus apricus, now treated as Parodia concinna var. aprica, literally means “sun-loving” — and it lives up to the name. Native to sunny hills of Uruguay and southern Brazil, it forms a small, flattened globe often only 3–4 cm wide, cloaked in bristle-like spines and crowned by large, brilliant yellow flowers with a contrasting red center. It prefers bright light with some protection from the hottest afternoon sun, very gritty, shallow pots for its fibrous root system, and regular summer water with strict winter dryness. Its striking flowers and compact habit make it perfect for windowsills, tiny rock gardens, and collectors who value intense color in a miniature form."

It tolerates cool conditions better than many cacti but can be frost-sensitive below about 6°C. Easy to grow from seed and rewarding in bloom, this species is a stalwart of traditional collections, prized for its large, daytime flowers and classic globose shape."
